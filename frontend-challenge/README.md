# UI Code Challenge!

This small assignment will hep evaluate your front end development capabilities.  You will be evaluated on design choices (friction, scalability, etc), efficient and effective coding, and style.

## Challenge

Create a mobile first, two page app for reviewing tennis courts.  A user should be able to see a display of courts, search for a specific court, select a court detail view, and leave a review.

## Rules

1. Pull this repo locally and work on your own branch
2. Maximum time is 4 hours
3. You will only be evaluated on how it looks on mobile device sizes
4. No backend, all data will be mocked
5. You do not need to write tests for this exercise given the time limit
6. When you are done, submit a PR to this repo.

## Hints 

- Do not use frameworks outside of the JavaScript/Typescript ecosystem
- Bonus points if you mock > 50 courts as this will let you show off your scalable design skills
- You can use coding assitants, but include every promopt you used in your PR
- Your job is to delight users

Good luck!
